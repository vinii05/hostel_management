# Hostel Management System using React and MySQL

A modern, interactive **Hostel Management System** built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with MySQL for the backend. The system allows managing students, room allocation, and fee management with a dark-mode interface.

## Problem Statement

Manual management of hostel students, rooms, and fees is error-prone and inefficient. A web-based system is needed for efficient and interactive management.

## Proposed Solution

The project uses React.js frontend with Node.js backend and MySQL database to allow:

- Adding, viewing, and managing student information  
- Allocating rooms dynamically  
- Recording and tracking fees  
- Viewing combined student-room-fee data  

---

## Technology Used

- React.js  
- Axios  
- Node.js & Express.js  
- MySQL  
- CSS  

---

## System Workflow

1. Add students and rooms  
2. Allocate rooms to students  
3. Record and manage fees  
4. View all data in one interface

## Database Structure

- Students: student_id, name, email, phone, gender, course  
- Rooms: room_id, room_number, capacity  
- Allocations: allocation_id, student_id,
